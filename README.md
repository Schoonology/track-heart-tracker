## Running the application

Track Heart Tracker requires Node v6 or greater. Once you have that installed:

- Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`, if you have Yarn installed).
- (Optional) Run the test suite with `npm test`. (All tests should pass.)
- Run the server with `npm start`.
